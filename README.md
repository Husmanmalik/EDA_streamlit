# Exploring Different ML Model:

This dashboard applies three supervised machine learning models – Random Forest, K-nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine – to three distinct datasets: iris, wine, and breast cancer. 
Additionally, the dashboard allows users to dynamically adjust the parameters of these models in real-time. By experimenting with different parameter values, users can identify the optimal settings that yield the highest accuracy for each model and dataset.
